#BIG-FASHION-GROUP-SALES-DASHBOARD

Apart from data analysis, there is a need to make tremendous insight from the data analysed and this can be easily done through visualization. Data visualization to me is a key part of the overall data management process and it ensures that facts are presented in simple ways that can be easy to interpret and comprehend. What makes it more interesting is the fact that it can be beefed up with various aesthetics which makes it more appealing and easy to behold whilst not minifying the tremendous insights that can be gleaned from it. 


A DASHBOARD THAT SHOWS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FOR BIG FASHION. IT WAS DONE USING PIVOT TABLE AND PIVOT CHART AND ITS INTERACTIVE.
